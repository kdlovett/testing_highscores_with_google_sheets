# testing_highscores_with_google_sheets
Just wanted to store some messing around I did with the Google Sheets API up here, because I want to do something more with it, but don't think I can make anything satisfying before school starts.

This file is based heavily on the quickstart provided by Google here:

Here are some other relevant and helpful links:
